At the ripe age of 32, I'm starting to appreciate the power of writing. The education system
could do a lot more to inspire students what writing can do for them instead of trying to
teach what good writing is with brute force. There are many purposes for writing, but my
favorites are:

- to convince someone to do something
- to change someone else's mind
- to change your own mind, and
- to test your own understanding

It wasn't until I started working that I saw the wide range of writing skill on the internet
and amongst my coworkers. About 30% of my replies on Slack are "wdym by ______" or "rephrase?"
Now that a lot of the workforce are working from home, it shows how important the medium through which
we work together is. If slack and e-mail are the roads and highways through which we communicate, our words
are the cars, and I find that most of us are driving ones that are decades old, check engine light on, and
needed an oil change 5K miles ago.

So, at the ripe age of 32, I feel that I know nothing of writing, and hope to improve.

Next Question:
1. Can I create a writing system that will always help me write better?
2. How much do other people care about writing?
3. Why do so many professional talk with jargon?
