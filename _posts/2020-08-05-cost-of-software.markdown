One of the things I love about software is that the marginal cost is near zero. Marginal cost is how much
it costs to make an additional unit of something. Let's say you're selling lemonade for $2, but it costs you $1 to make it.
Even if your business goes viral, and sell one million cups of lemonade, your cost per cup won't change too much from $1. Not to
mention all of the other work you'll need to do to meet the demand for one million customers. On the other hand, if you sell
a game like solitaire for $1. If it cost you $100,000 to build that game, every unit of the game you sell costs you almost near $0. 
You just need to sell 100,000 units of solitaire to break even, and then every additional unit you sell is pure profit. 

Next Question:
1. What's the bad news about software?
2. Why am I not rich and on the cover of magazines?
