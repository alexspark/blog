What is this?

I write because it mirrors the mind. There's an elusive difference between
knowing something and feeling like you know something. Writing is a tool
to test ideas and discover the depths of my own understanding.
Most of the time, it's very shallow.

I write about my interests, beliefs, and things I learn.
