You just need to sell 100,000 units of solitaire to break even, and then every additional unit you sell is pure profit." />

    <p>One of the things I love about software is that the marginal cost is near zero. Marginal cost is how much
it costs to make an additional unit of something. Let’s say you’re selling lemonade for $2, but it costs you $1 to make it.
Even if your business goes viral, and sell one million cups of lemonade, your cost per cup won’t change too much from $1. Not to

a game like solitaire for $1. If it cost you $100,000 to build that game, every unit of the game you sell costs you almost near $0. 
You just need to sell 100,000 units of solitaire to break even, and then every additional unit you sell is pure profit.</p>
